Welcome to LSMTool's documentation!
===================================

LSMTool is a Python package which allow the manipulation of sky models in the ``makesourcedb`` format understood by BBS. Note that LSMTool is still in beta. Please report bugs to ``drafferty@hs.uni-hamburg.de``. To initialize your environment for LSMTool, users on CEP1 and CEP2 should run the following commands::

    use LofIm
    source ~rafferty/init_lsmtool

Note that the Pythonlibs LOFAR package includes an older version of astropy that conflicts with LSMTool and cannot be used in conjunction with it.
